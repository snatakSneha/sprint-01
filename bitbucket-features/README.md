## 1. Introduction

This document presents a detailed evaluation of **Bitbucket**, a cloud-based Git repository management tool developed by Atlassian. It explores Bitbucket's core features, integration capabilities, CI/CD workflows using Pipelines, access control mechanisms, and its alignment with enterprise DevOps practices. The document serves as a decision-support tool for teams considering Bitbucket as part of their software development lifecycle.
